# Sparkify-ML_Pipeline
A feature engineering pipeline and ML model using PySpark, This Project is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

Sparkify is an Music streaming platform just like Spotify. We have to create a ML model to predict customer churn based on the events data provided by Udacity.

I have also created a blog post on medium to give a step by step overview of this project:

## Project Instructions

## Libraries:

1. Python 3.6
2. PySpark ML
3. Jupyter
4. pandas

## Dataset: 
mini_sparkify_event_data.json this dataset is provided by udacity for this project.

## Files:
1. Sparkify.ipynb - This notebook contains the below mentioned steps which are required to complete this project.

## Steps in this project:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering 
3. Modeling
4. Results
 
Models used: Logistic Regression and Randomforest Classifier

Model Evaluation: Used F1 score and Accuracy to evaluate model performance.

In the blogpost, I have discussed on Important features for models and few ways to improve these results.

## Results

  F1 score:  0.826420504937
  Accuracy:  0.961674657232
